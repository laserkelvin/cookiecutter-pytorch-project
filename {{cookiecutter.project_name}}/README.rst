Features

Requirements

* TODO


Installation
------------

The project environment for {{cookiecutter.friendly_name}} combines modern Python
environment and tooling with flexibility to use more performant, tuned software
stacks to squeeze extra deep learning performance. For the latter, ``conda`` is 
recommended, but is not a requirement to run this package as it is also designed
for continuous development on a variety of environments (i.e. laptops).

Starting from ``conda``:

.. code:: console

   $ conda create -n {{cookiecutter.package_name}} python=3.9
   $ conda activate {{cookiecutter.package_name}}
   $ pip install .

For developer installs, run ``pip install './[dev]'``. The idea is that the ``pip``
installation provides the bare minimum dependencies, however does not guarantee
performance. It is up to the user to build PyTorch from source in order to include
things like MPI support, etc.


Usage
-----

Please see the `Command-line Reference <Usage_>`_ for details.

A brief summary of what each folder is designed for:

#. `data` contains copies of the data used for this project. It is recommended to form a pipeline whereby the `raw` data is preprocessed, serialized to `interim`, and when ready for analysis, placed into `processed`.
#. `models` contains serialized weights intended for distribution, and/or testing.
#. `notebooks` contains three subfolders: `dev` is for notebook based development, `exploratory` for data exploration, and `reports` for making figures and visualizations for writeup.
#. `scripts` contains files that meant for headless routines, generally those with long compute times such as model training and data cleaning.
#. `src/{{cookiecutter.package_name}}` contains the common code base for this project.


Code development
----------------

All of the code used for this project should be contained in `src/{{cookiecutter.package_name}}`,
at least in terms of the high-level functionality (i.e. not scripts), and is intended to be
a standalone Python package.

The package is structured to match the abstractions for deep learning, specifically PyTorch, 
PyTorch Lightning, and Weights and Biases, by separating parts of data structures and processing
and model/layer development.

Some concise tenets for development

* Write unit tests as you go.
* Commit changes, and commit frequently. Write `semantic`_ git commits!
* Formatting is done with ``black``; don't fuss about it ðŸ˜ƒ
* For new Python dependencies, use `poetry add <package>`.
* For new environment dependencies, use `conda env export -f environment.yml`.

Notes on best practices, particularly regarding CI/CD, can be found in the extensive
documentation for the `Hypermodern Python Cookiecutter`_ repository.
